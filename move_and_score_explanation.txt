g-score is the cost for Paul to get to a specific square from his position.
h-score is the cost from that particular square to the cake.
f-score is the sum of g and h.

Diagonal - In this case, Paul has no choice but to go diagonally from his starting position even though it is
more costly because the squares directly next to him and below him are blocked off by lava. 

Hop - For this situation, Paul must hop over the lava in order to move past his starting position since
all the squares surrounding him on each side are filled with lava. Hopping costs 8 extra moves but it is necessary here.

Swamp - For Paul to reach the cake, he must go through the swamp even though it slows him down because the swamp
blocks off all pathways that lead to the cake.
