g-score is the cost for Paul to get to a specific square from his position.
This screenshot portrays the values associated with g-score particularly when looking at the first free square below Paul, which displays a score of 8. The cost of movement for hopping is 8, which is why that tile displays that value. The squares that are closer to the cake have higher g-scores.

h-score is the cost from that particular square to the cake. The squares that are directly in contact with the square with the cake are labelled with a 1 meaning they are 1 movement cost away from the destination. Another example would be the starting square which has a number 18 in it. This means that the starting square is 18 movement points away from the cake. The squares that are closer to the cake have lower h-scores.

f-score is the sum of g and h. This is revealed on the screenshot for f-score through the fact that each of the squares in Paul's path have the exact same value of 18. The fact that the g-score increases by 1 movement cost for each additional square in Paul's path is offset by the decrease in h-score by 1 movement cost. 

Diagonal - In this case, Paul has no choice but to go diagonally from his starting position even though it is
more costly because the squares directly next to him and below him are blocked off by lava. 

Hop - For this situation, Paul must hop over the lava in order to move past his starting position since
all the squares surrounding him on each side are filled with lava. Hopping costs 8 extra moves but it is necessary here.

Swamp - For Paul to reach the cake, he must go through the swamp even though it slows him down because the swamp
blocks off all pathways that lead to the cake.
